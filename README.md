# Wave
Wave is a semi-complete Java game I've been developing on
and off for the past year and some.
Despite its deceptively simple appearance, there is a lot
of complexities that have gone into this game.
Originally based on an incomplete tutorial on YouTube, I
just let my creative juices flow and create this.

## Gameplay

As a line, it is your job to dodge other lines. Overcome bosses, fast enemies, and even some smart ones. As you rack points and win.
With a wide range of options and features, you can custom-tailor the game to your needs. 
With tons of epic songs to keep you in the beat, you can get hours of intense, fun, gaming.

## Options
Not only do you have a great time playing, there are a wide range of options available in game that you can toggle to give you the best experience possible.

Features include:
 - [x] Music
 - [x] Background
 - [x] Trail
 - [x] Controls
 - [x] Particles
 - [x] Fancy Buttons
 - [x] Geek Stats
 - [x] Color

And more on the way!

## Future Development
Lots of exciting features in store, stay tuned for more.
